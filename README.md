## About Me
Hi there visitor! ðŸ‘‹ <br>
I'm a Data Scientist with expertise in neurophysiological signals and machine learning applications. My work focuses on:
- EEG and iEEG signal processing and analysis
- Machine learning for biomedical applications
- Software development for research and clinical tools
- Data engineering and cloud-based solutions

Currently working at the [**Alberta Children's Hospital**](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/research/alberta-children-epilepsy/meet-us/staff-0) with ongoing collaborations with [**Persyst**](https://www.persyst.com/).
I hold a PhD in Computational Neuroscience from the University of Freiburg, Germany, and a Master's degree in Electronic Implants from the University of Bern, Switzerland.


## Projects

### EEG Biomarker Detection
- Development of [`elpi`](https://www.elpi-biomarkers.com): EEG analysis software for annotation and classification
- Machine learning classification of large-scale EEG datasets using HPC infrastructure

### Sleep-Spindles and their differences throughout infancy
- [`SleepSpindles`](https://github.com/Daniel-Lachner-Piza/spindle-detector)
- Provide a description of how widespread spindles are
- Analyze spindle characteristics across pediatrric age groups:
  - Peak frequency
  - Power
  - Duration
  - Propagation extent
- [Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027017304417?via%3Dihub)

### Sleep-stage Spike Analysis
- Collaborative project with Persyst for iEEG biomarker analysis across sleep stages
- Development of data pipeline using PostgreSQL, Docker, and Dash for clinical data visualization
- Statistical modeling for seizure onset zone prediction

### MLOps and Data Engineering
- Implementation of MLOps practices using MLflow, Prefect, Docker, and AWS services
- Data engineering pipeline for efficient data processing and model deployment
